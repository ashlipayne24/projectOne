    <p> Currently I am studying to recieve my bachelor's degree in visual communiation design. During my sophomore year of high school is when I truly gained a strong interest in the art of graphic design.</p> 
    <p>I've always enjoyed doing art as a hobby and i consider myself to be a fast learneer when it comes to learning technology so, I thought that graphic design was perfect for me since it combined the two.</p> 
    <p>Since then I still enjoy being able to think creatively but have realized that graphic design isn't ultimately all i want to do in life. After I graduate I want to further my education and attend graduate shcool to earn my masters in social work.</p> 
    <p>I hope to have a career in this field later on in life because going out of my way to help people and putting others before my self is what I've always been known to do </p>
    <p> I also play on the women's basketball team here and plan to play professionally overseas immediately after I graduate. </p> 
    <p> Obviously I have a few plans, but if i have the chance to play overseas then I definitely want to do that because who wouldn't want to travel? </p>
